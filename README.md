#### Composing multiple GraphQL services into a single graph

This project accompanies the [apollo federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/federation/introduction/) implementation using NodeJS and ApolloServer.

- Apollo Federation is an architecture for composing multiple GraphQL services into a single graph that addresses this need. Unlike other approaches such as schema stitching, it is based on a declarative composition programming model that allows proper separation of concerns. This design allows teams to implement an enterprise-scale shared data graph as a set of loosely coupled, separately maintained GraphQL services.
